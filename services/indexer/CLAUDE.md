# CLAUDE.md — indexer

Chain-event indexer feeding the query store used by `services/api/`.

## Conventions

- Indexing must be idempotent and resumable: reprocessing a block range must
  not corrupt or duplicate derived data.
- Treat chain data as the source of truth; derived tables are rebuildable.
- Schema migrations live with the service and must run cleanly on an empty
  database.
- Security ([`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md)): persist only public chain
  data plus minimal operational data — no user-identifiable information, no
  IP-to-address linkage (including logs); treat indexed events as untrusted
  input; never hold keys or sign.

## Commands

To be filled in when the service scaffold lands.
